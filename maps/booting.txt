"booting" is a map that is intended to be used to start the server and immediately be switched out to another map. For example, the server is started with the "+map booting" on the command line, but "booting.cfg" has "changelevel pl_badwater" on the very first line. This immediate level swap has the benefit of giving the server time for SourceTV and/or the Replay system to activate, AND allows the server's "starting map" to be changed without needing to modify the startup script.

The map "itemtest" could also be used for this purpose, but some like to use it for strange item leveling, so I opted to create this map instead.
